## Usage with Typescript

This repository comes with the Typescript typings bundled. No need to download them separately!

Make sure the `src/client.d.ts` file is accessible to the Typescript compiler. Do this by making sure it's an included file in tsconfig.json by adding a `typeRoots` defininition. (Required Typescript 2.0 or higher.)

>  "typeRoots": [
     "./node_modules/deepstream.io-client.js/src/client.d.ts"
    ]

## Install in react-native  

For usage in react-native the bundled client available at `dist/bundle/ds.js` must be used. In order to automatically change the main file in package.json to the bundle file install as: `DEEPSTREAM_ENV=react-native npm install @deepstream/client`. Also the metro bundler must be configured. Check the [documentation](https://deepstream.io/tutorials/integrations/mobile/reactnative/) for more details
