# [4.0.0-beta.1] - 2017-11-21

This release of the client includes a full rewrite in TypeScript and a move away from the old text-based protocol to the Universal Realtime Protocol (URP). This means the client is not compatible with [deepstream.io](https://github.com/deepstreamio/deepstream.io) prior to version v4.0.0.

## Features

### Additional events

- **clientDataChanged**: emitted every time the server sends new the client new data after authenticating

```javascript
client.on('clientDataChanged', clientData => { ... })
```

- **reauthenticationFailure**: emitted when a client is unable to authenticate with the server after a reconnection. This will only be called for automatic reconnection attempts during connection loss or similar, if calling the `login` function authentication is as normal

```javascript
client.on('reAuthenticationFailure', reason => { ... })
```

## Improvements

### Promisified API's

- Presence
```javascript
client.presence.getAll()
  .then(users => {})
  .catch(error => {})

client.presence.getAll(users)
  .then(users => {})
  .catch(error => {})
```

- RPC
```javascript
client.rpc.make(name, data)
  .then(data => {})
  .catch(error => {})
```

- Record Factory

```javascript
client.record.snapshot(recordName)
  .then(data => {})
  .catch(error => {})

client.record.has(recordName)
  .then(exists => {})
  .catch(error => {})

client.record.head(recordName)
  .then(version => {})
  .catch(error => {})
```

- Record

```javascript
record.whenReady()
  .then(() => {})
record.delete()
  .then(() => {})
  .catch(error => {})
```

### Improved record error handling

Permission errors of any kind are now routed to the record instance that had the error. Consider the following snippet

```javascript
client.on('error', (description, event, topic) => { ... })
const record = client.record.getRecord('permission-error')
record.set('firstname', 'Homer')
```

In this instance all errors are passed to the global client error handler. When dealing with multiple records, it is difficult to correlate errors to different records. We now support the following

```javascript
const record = client.record.getRecord('permission-error')
record.on('error', (description, event, topic) => { ... })
record.set('firstname', 'Homer')
```

### TypeScript

This release includes a full rewrite of the client in TypeScript, fixing many bugs and improving the client quality.

### Client-server binary protocol

A full implementation of the Universal Realtime Protocol (URP) to match deepstream v4.

## Breaking changes

### Chaining

Many functions are no longer chainable (returning an instance of the client or a record) due to supporting promises. This means calls like `client.login` and will return a promise if no callback is provided.

### Module exports

Previously a function was exported that allowed creating an instance of the client as follows

```javascript
const deepstream = require('deepstream.io-client-js')
const client = deepstream('DEEPSTREAM_URL')
// constants also accessible via deepstream.C
```

We now support the following

```javascript
const { deepstream, C, EVENT, CONNECTION_STATE } = require('deepstream.io-client-js')
```

### Login

As mentioned higher up, the callback passed to the login function now is called just once. In order to handle client reconnections the `clientDataChanged` and `reAuthenticationFailure` events should be used instead.

### Listening

The `isSubscribed` flag in the listener callback was removed and now the response object
has an `onStop` function which will be called when there are no more subscribers on the topic.

With this change the same context is kept when a subscription is found or removed
and the listen callback now is called just once.

For those familiar with listening, this

```javascript
client.record.listen('^news/.*', (match, isSubscribed, response) => {
  if (isSubscribed) {
    if (/* able to provide for this match */) {
      response.accept()
      // start providing data
    } else {
      response.reject()
    }
    return
  }
  // stop providing data
})
```

turns into this:

```javascript
client.record.listen('^news/.*', (match, response) => {
  if (/* unable to provide for this match */) {
    response.reject()
    return
  }
  response.accept()
  response.onStop((match) => {
    // stop providing data
  })
  // start providing data
})
```
- Presence

The callback for `client.presence.getAll` is now called with an error parameter in standard JavaScript convention

```javascript
client.presence.getAll((error, userList) => { ... })
client.presence.getAll(users, (error, userMap) => { ... })
```

## [2.3.0] - 2017-09-25

### Features

- the presence feature can now be used on a per user basis. The online status of individual users can be queried for as well as subscribed to. Check out the tutorial on our website [here](https://deepstreamhub.com/tutorials/guides/presence/)

### Improvements

- error messages are now stringified to better display information [#386](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/386) courtesy of [@SejH](@SejH)

## Fixes
- Heartbeat timeout now emits the reconnect event

## [2.1.5] - 2017-05-03

### Bug Fixes
- Calling login() with a callback (but no auth data) now behaves as you would expect.

  subscribing to who is online within a cluster. For example:
  ``` javascript
  ds.presence.getAll((users) => {
    users.forEach((username) => {
      console.log(`${username} is online`)
    })
  })
  ds.presence.subscribe((username, loggedIn) => {
    if (loggedIn) {

### Bug Fixes

- fix leaking internal reference to the record data  [#202](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/202) by [@ronag](@ronag)

### Enhancements

###### `listen(pattern, isSubscribed, response)`
add a third argument for the listen callback (`client.record.listen` and `client.event.listen`) which contains
an object which two functions (`accept` and `reject`). One of these functions needs to be called otherwise you
will get a deprecated message. [#203](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/203) [#212](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/212)

This enhancements fixes some issues like [#74](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/74) [#155](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/155) [#170](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/170)

###### provider flag and event
Records supports now a boolean flag (`record.hasProvider`) which indicates whether a listener has accepted providing data. You can also subscribe to event which is triggered when the flag changes:

```javascript
record.on('hasProviderChanged', hasProvider => {
  /* do something */
})
```

###### API checks are now in place that throw an error if you provide the incorrect argument amount or types [#207](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/227) by [@ronag](@ronag)

### Misc

###### Gherkin tests are now used for E2E testing, allowing e2e tests to be run against any language rather than just node, and allows writing more scenarios much easier

## [1.0.2] - 2016-07-28

### Bug Fixes

- allow do create and discard the same record in a synchronous loop [#167](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/167)
- record snapshots are not waiting for `isReady` [#140](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/140)
- record subscriptions are not waiting for `isReady` in combination with `triggerNow` [#138](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/138)
- broken unsubscribe due to wrong internal argument delegation [#190](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/190)


### Enhancements

- provide a `MAX_RECONNECTION_ATTEMPTS_REACHED` event [#175](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/175)
- provide a `maxReconnectInterval` option [#176](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/176)

###  Features

- Terminate unauthenticated connections after a timeout [#226](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/226)

## [1.0.1] - 2016-07-19

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where deleted record was not getting removed

## [1.0.0] - 2016-07-10

### Features

###### Merge Conflict Resolution #4
Users can now set a global and per record merge strategy. This allows the application to respond to `VERSION_EXISTS` and use a `REMOTE_WINS`, `LOCAL_WINS` or a custom merge strategy

Global:
```javascript
const client = deepstream( 'localhost:6020', {
    mergeStrategy: deepstream.MERGE_STRATEGIES.REMOTE_WINS
});
```

Local:
```javascript
const record = client.record.getRecord( 'user/1' )
record.setMergeStrategy( ( record, remoteValue, remoteVersion, callback ) => {
  callback( null, remoteValue )
} )
```


#### Enhancements

###### Connection Redirects
deepstream protocol now has a connection establishment handshake that allows the client to be redirected to another deepstream before requesting/publishing data

###### Record deletes #111
Users can now delete content within records by setting it to undefined

```javascript
record.set( path, undefined )
```

###### Reduced client size #75
Client size bundle has been reduced by not including mocks for the tcp connection

###### Discard/Delete only on ready #94
Record discards and deletes now get called after when ready, which makes the API cleaner

Before:
```javascript
record = client.record.getRecord( 'user1' )
record.set( 'name', 'bob' )
record.onReady( () => {
  record.discard()
})
```

Now:
```javascript
record = client.record.getRecord( 'user1' )
record
  .set( 'name', 'bob' )
  .discard()
```

###### Exposed Constants
You can now access constants on deepstream

```javascript
// on the constructor
const C = deepstream.CONSTANTS;
// and instance
const client = deepstream( 'localhost:6020' )
CONST C = client.CONSTANTS;
```

### Breaking Changes

###### Login callback

The login callback now only takes two arguments instead of three. This is to make it easier for the user to send their own custom data from an authentication hander or when using the http authentication handler

```javascript
client.login( {}, ( success, data ) => {
  if( success ) {
    // data is meta data associated with user session
    // or null
  } else {
    // data is error message or custom error object
    // with reason why or null
  }
} )
```

###### EngineIO Default Path
We now use `deepstream` instead of `engine.io` as the default engineio path

### Bug Fixes

- Login after logout doesn't overide auth parameters #88

- Deepstream not updating object properties #96 ( @drsirmrpresidentfathercharles )
