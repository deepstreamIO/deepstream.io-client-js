## [2.2.0] - 2017-05-29

### Features
- Clients are now able to perform and upsert operation `CU` (create and update) via `RecordHandler.setData`. This allows writing to records while not subscribed to them locally

## Fixes
- Heartbeat timeout now emits the reconnect event

## [2.1.5] - 2017-05-03

### Bug Fixes
- Calling login() with a callback (but no auth data) now behaves as you would expect.
- Fix issue where client did not emit `MAX_RECONNECTION_ATTEMPTS_REACHED` event by [@rbarroetavena](@rbarroetavena).

## [2.1.4] - 2017-04-11

### Enhancements
- Tightened up typescript callback interfaces by [@EnigmaCurry](@EnigmaCurry)

### Small Fixes
- Using main file as `dist/deepstream.js` over `src/client.js`

## [2.1.3] - 2017-04-08

### Enhancements
- Write acks now called with a failure message if connection is down by [@Erik Karlsson](@Erik Karlsson)
- Write acks now called with null if value hasn't changed by [@Erik Karlsson](@Erik Karlsson)
- Linting / Babel support
- Improved a few typescript bindings by [@EnigmaCurry](@EnigmaCurry)
- Changed heartbeat missed message to include time
- Setting anonymous record with same name no longer discards and resubscribes the record

### Bug Fixes

- Invalid remote wins merge conflicts
- Prevent records from being set with scalar values by [@datasage](@datasage)
- Prevent bad login message from constantly attempting to reconnect by [@datasage](@datasage)
- RecordHandler invalid destroy state emitted an error instead of using client._$onError

## [2.1.2] - 2017-02-28

### Enhancements

- heartbeat missed should close connection [#324](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/324)
- optimized json-path patch [#329](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/329)
- TypeScript typings [#283](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/283) and [#338](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/338)
- Added support for non-NaNish base 16 numbers in jsonpath [#328](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/328)
- There is now a single ack timeout registry for the client, shared between all handlers. This means that ack timeouts are cleared when the connection is lost and don't occur when the connection is not open [#342](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/342)

### Bug Fixes

- reset queued methods in List once called [#315](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/315)

## [2.0.0] - 2016-11-18

### Features
- Added support for the deepstream `presence` API, enabling querying and
  subscribing to who is online within a cluster. For example:
  ``` javascript
  ds.presence.getAll((users) => {
    users.forEach((username) => {
      console.log(`${username} is online`)
    })
  })
  ds.presence.subscribe((username, loggedIn) => {
    if (loggedIn) {
      console.log(`${username} has logged in`)
    } else {
      console.log(`${username} has logged out`)
    }
  })
  ```
### Enhancements

- Added heartbeats over WebSocket connection
- Presence has been added to query and subscribe to who is online with the cluster
- E2E tests refactored

[#408](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/408)
- We now depend only on browser/node.js WebSockets, removing support for TCP and engine.io
- Support for webRTC has been removed

## [1.1.1] - 2016-09-30

### Bug Fixes

- Connection errors now occur on the CONNECTION topic
- Message denied clears down associated ACK timeout messages

### Enhancements

- Optimize and refactor records by [@ronag](@ronag)

### Misc

- Porting over remaining e2e tests
- Adding specs as part of the client project and build

## [1.1.0] - 2016-09-08

### Bug Fixes

- fix leaking internal reference to the record data  [#202](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/202) by [@ronag](@ronag)

### Enhancements

###### `listen(pattern, isSubscribed, response)`
add a third argument for the listen callback (`client.record.listen` and `client.event.listen`) which contains
an object which two functions (`accept` and `reject`). One of these functions needs to be called otherwise you
will get a deprecated message. [#203](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/203) [#212](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/212)

This enhancements fixes some issues like [#74](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/74) [#155](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/155) [#170](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/170)

###### provider flag and event
Records supports now a boolean flag (`record.hasProvider`) which indicates whether a listener has accepted providing data. You can also subscribe to event which is triggered when the flag changes:

```javascript
record.on('hasProviderChanged', hasProvider => {
  /* do something */
})
```

###### API checks are now in place that throw an error if you provide the incorrect argument amount or types [#207](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/227) by [@ronag](@ronag)

### Misc

###### Gherkin tests are now used for E2E testing, allowing e2e tests to be run against any language rather than just node, and allows writing more scenarios much easier

## [1.0.2] - 2016-07-28

### Bug Fixes

- allow do create and discard the same record in a synchronous loop [#167](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/167)
- record snapshots are not waiting for `isReady` [#140](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/140)
- record subscriptions are not waiting for `isReady` in combination with `triggerNow` [#138](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/138)
- broken unsubscribe due to wrong internal argument delegation [#190](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/190)


### Enhancements

- provide a `MAX_RECONNECTION_ATTEMPTS_REACHED` event [#175](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/175)
- provide a `maxReconnectInterval` option [#176](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/176)

###  Features

- Terminate unauthenticated connections after a timeout [#226](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/226)

## [1.0.1] - 2016-07-19

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where deleted record was not getting removed

## [1.0.0] - 2016-07-10

### Features

###### Merge Conflict Resolution #4
Users can now set a global and per record merge strategy. This allows the application to respond to `VERSION_EXISTS` and use a `REMOTE_WINS`, `LOCAL_WINS` or a custom merge strategy

Global:
```javascript
const client = deepstream( 'localhost:6020', {
    mergeStrategy: deepstream.MERGE_STRATEGIES.REMOTE_WINS
});
```

Local:
```javascript
const record = client.record.getRecord( 'user/1' )
record.setMergeStrategy( ( record, remoteValue, remoteVersion, callback ) => {
  callback( null, remoteValue )
} )
```


#### Enhancements

###### Connection Redirects
deepstream protocol now has a connection establishment handshake that allows the client to be redirected to another deepstream before requesting/publishing data

###### Record deletes #111
Users can now delete content within records by setting it to undefined

```javascript
record.set( path, undefined )
```

###### Reduced client size #75
Client size bundle has been reduced by not including mocks for the tcp connection

###### Discard/Delete only on ready #94
Record discards and deletes now get called after when ready, which makes the API cleaner

Before:
```javascript
record = client.record.getRecord( 'user1' )
record.set( 'name', 'bob' )
record.onReady( () => {
  record.discard()
})
```

Now:
```javascript
record = client.record.getRecord( 'user1' )
record
  .set( 'name', 'bob' )
  .discard()
```

###### Exposed Constants
You can now access constants on deepstream

```javascript
// on the constructor
const C = deepstream.CONSTANTS;
// and instance
const client = deepstream( 'localhost:6020' )
CONST C = client.CONSTANTS;
```

### Breaking Changes

###### Login callback

The login callback now only takes two arguments instead of three. This is to make it easier for the user to send their own custom data from an authentication hander or when using the http authentication handler

```javascript
client.login( {}, ( success, data ) => {
  if( success ) {
    // data is meta data associated with user session
    // or null
  } else {
    // data is error message or custom error object
    // with reason why or null
  }
} )
```

###### EngineIO Default Path
We now use `deepstream` instead of `engine.io` as the default engineio path

### Bug Fixes

- Login after logout doesn't overide auth parameters #88

- Deepstream not updating object properties #96 ( @drsirmrpresidentfathercharles )
