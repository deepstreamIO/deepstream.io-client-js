### Task

Implement CI using github actions.

## [5.2.0] - 2020.12.29

### Breaking Change

Remove rpcAcceptTimeout and rpcResponseTimeout from client logic. These timeouts will be handled server side only.

## [5.1.12] - 2020.12.4

### Fix

- send heartbeats strictly according to `heartbeatInterval`.


## [5.1.11] - 2020.12.1

### Fix

- Discard all references of a record when calling `.discard()`
- Remove subscriptions from record reference when calling `.unsubscribe()`

## [5.1.4] - 2020.07.29

### Chore

- Bump dependencies

## [5.1.3] - 2020.07.14

### Fix

- set main file in package.json to `dist/src/deepstream.js`
- add postinstall script that works when passing the `DEEPSTREAM_ENV=react-native` variable to the npm install command in order to change the main file in package.json to `dist/bundle/ds.min.js` for react-native usage.


## [5.1.2] - 2020.07.05

### Fix

- set main file in package.json to minified bundle
- Revert the explicit Buffer import since it's not required when using the bundled client file.

## [5.1.1] - 2020.06.30

### Fix

- Manipulate string url in socket factory without external dependencies. Fixes #515
- Export the client constructor as object in order to maintain api in bundle.Fixes #528
- Make explicit Buffer import. Fixes #529

## [5.1.0] - 2020.05.11

### Feature

Send down sdkVersion and sdkType to server on challenge for better metrics

### Fix

Fixes #504: WriteAcks on conflicts

  This needs to be used with server 5.0.17 in order to work.

  The issue was VERSION_EXISTS didn't go through the ack service
  which resulted in it never reacting.

  To test this, run `ts-node bugs/504-merge-conflict-silent.ts` in
  two terminals

Fix connection timeouts if server doesn't send something in time

When a user has permission to read but not write to record, when trying to set with ack the error callback was not triggered and the client hanged indefinitely.

## [5.0.8] - 2020.04.15

### Fix

Deep-compare method in record change event emitter, this prevents spurious events when users are subscribed to a record path pointing to an object.

### Improvement

Updating dependencies

## [5.0.7] - 2020.02.08

### Fix

Revert: Allow to work on react native (at cost of bigger bundle size)

## [5.0.6] - 2020.02.08

### Improvement

Updating dependencies

### Fix

Allow to work on react native (at cost of bigger bundle size)

## [5.0.5] - 2019.11.21

### Fix

Method signature for the `DeepstreamClient.login()` overload that takes only a callback was incorrect

## [5.0.4] - 2019.11.03

### Fix

Linting issue failed release build

## [5.0.3] - 2019.11.03

### Fix

Actual library fix, previous one was a spoof

## [5.0.2] - 2019.11.03

### Fix

Adding library directly into browser from webpack should expose DeepstreamClient globally

## [5.0.1] - 2019.10.29

### Fix

Added a missing transition state on record resubscription

## [5.0.0] - 2019.10.27

### Breaking Change

Importing and creating the client has changed in order to be less insane when using typescript.

When creating the client you now do:

```typescript
const { DeepstreamClient } = require('@deepstream/client')
const dsClient = new DeepstreamClient(url, options)
```

instead of:

```javascript
const deepstream = require('@deepstream/client')
const dsClient = deepstream(url, options)
```

## [4.1.3] - 2019.09.09

### Fix

Another socketOptions defaulting issue

## [4.1.2] - 2019.09.09

### Fix

Defaulting socketOptions in socket wrapper factory.

# [4.1.1] - 2019-09-08

### Feature

Adding a `jsonTransportMode` flag that can be passed to `socketOptions` that allows the client
to talk to the server in JSON. This is mainly done to help people to debug writing new SDKs and
should not be used in production.

# [4.1.0] - 2019-09-05

### Improvement

Including a default implementation of timeouts using the native setTimeout API. The interval based one was created in order to mitigate the insane amount
of ack registries we used to have get created, and also because setting timeouts
isn't cheap (you can verify this by creating a couple thousand records and noticing the cost within the default noop storage registry). However as correctly stated by @Krishna [here](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/500) the interval implementation is naive in terms of mobile (looping every 20milliseconds for idle connections is overkill) and the benefits now is no longer as apparent as during the RC release (since bulk messaging now only makes one timeout for N amount amount of subscriptions).

You can toggle them with the following:

```
# When true uses setTimeout
nativeTimerRegistry: true,
# When nativeTimerRegistry is false uses an interval with this timer resolution
intervalTimerResolution: 50,
```

Either ways both implementations are expensive in terms of garbage collection since it binds to the context and data as part of the API. This can probably be avoided by providing a null context going forward.

### Fix

Lists were not propagating the events on record-core. Discard, delete and error is now properly passed, and documentation needs to be updated to indicate the ready event was dropped in V4

# [4.0.5] - 2019-08-30

### Improvement

The initial version change seems to have broken some things, so it is now configurable and defaults to 1

# [4.0.4] - 2019-08-19

### Feature

If record is in readonly mode, only subscribe and read, don't try to upsert / create

# [4.0.3] - 2019-08-09

### Feature

Adding notify on record handler to notify if the db was changed without using deepstream APIs

### Fix

Change error message on connection to pass through error

### Breaking Change

This shouldn't be a breaking change for those with offline disabled, which noone is using yet
hence the patch release. This just changes the initial version 1 to 0

### Fix:

# [4.0.2] - 2019-08-03

### Fix:

- Adding a readOnlyFlag

This is an issue where when not doing offline first requesting a record that doesn't exist would result in a new empty record being created (locally) with no data. This would break bindings for some people. Instead what we do now is use a recordReadOnlyMode flag which indicates that we expected most records to be only ever read from server, and hence will only be ready on data load. You can explicitly mention the things you do want to write to via a recordPrefixWriteWhitelist.

- Also added a transition from unsubscribing to deleted, because so many transitions.

# [4.0.1] - 2019-08-03

### Fix:

- Do a deep compare when setting data to avoid processing unchanged values

# [4.0.0] - 2019-07-30

### Features:

- New binary protocol support (under the hood)
- Bulk actions support (under the hood)
- Full typescript declaration files
- Promises everywhere! Long live async/await!
- Offline record support

```JavaScript
{
    // Use indexdb to store data client side
    offlineEnabled: false,
    // Save each update as it comes in from the server
    saveUpdatesOffline: false,
    indexdb: {
        // The db version, incrementing this triggers a db upgrade
        dbVersion: 1,
        // This auto updates the indexdb version if the objectStore names change
        autoVersion: false,
        // The key to index records by
        primaryKey: 'id',
        // The indexdb databae name
        storageDatabaseName: 'deepstream',
        // The default store name if not using a '/' to indicate the object store (example person/uuid)
        defaultObjectStoreName: 'records',
        // The object store names, required in advance due to how indexdb works
        objectStoreNames: [],
        // Things to not save, such search results
        ignorePrefixes: [],
        // The amount of time to buffer together actions before making a request
        flushTimeout: 50
    }
}
```

- Customizable offline storage support

```typescript
export type offlineStoreWriteResponse = ((error: string | null, recordName: string) => void)

export interface RecordOfflineStore {
  get: (recordName: string, callback: ((recordName: string, version: number, data: RecordData) => void)) => void
  set: (recordName: string, version: number, data: RecordData, callback: offlineStoreWriteResponse) => void
  delete: (recordName: string, callback: offlineStoreWriteResponse) => void
}
```

### Improvements

- Separation of errors and warnings for clarity. Non critical failures (such as an ack timeout) can now be treated separated or fully muted.
- Enhanced services to reduce timeout overhead

### Backwards compatibility

- Only works with V4 server
- All single response APIs now return promises when not providing a callback. This means most APIs that could have been chained would now break.

```JavaScript
const client = deepstream()
try {
    await client.login()

    const record = client.record.getRecord(name)
    await record.whenReady()

    const data = await client.record.snapshot(name)
    const version = await client.record.head(name)
    const exists = await client.record.has(name)
    const result = await client.rpc.make(name, data)
    const users = await client.presence.getAll()
} catch (e) {
    console.log('Error occurred', e)
}
```

- Listening

The listening API has been ever so slightly tweaked in order to simplify removing an active subscription.

Before when an active provider was started you would usually need to store it in a higher scope, for example:

```typescript
const listeners = new Map()

client.record.listen('users/.*', (name, isSubscribed, ({ accept, reject }) => {
    if (isSubscribed) {
        const updateInterval = setInterval(updateRecord.bind(this, name), 1000)
        listeners.set(name, updateInterval)
        accept()
    } else {
        clearTimeout(listeners.get(name))
        listeners.delete(name)
    }
})
```

Where now we instead do:

```typescript
const listeners = new Map()

client.record.listen('users/.*', (name, ({ accept, reject, onStop }) => {
    const updateInterval = setInterval(updateRecord.bind(this, name), 1000)
    accept()

    onStop(() => clearTimeout(updateInterval))
})
```

- Added support for the deepstream `presence` API, enabling querying and
  subscribing to who is online within a cluster. For example:
  ``` javascript
  ds.presence.getAll((users) => {
    users.forEach((username) => {
      console.log(`${username} is online`)
    })
  })
  ds.presence.subscribe((username, loggedIn) => {
    if (loggedIn) {
      console.log(`${username} has logged in`)
    } else {
      console.log(`${username} has logged out`)
    }
  })
  ```

- Connection errors now occur on the CONNECTION topic
- Message denied clears down associated ACK timeout messages

### Enhancements

- Optimize and refactor records by [@ronag](@ronag)

### Misc

## [1.1.0] - 2016-09-08

### Bug Fixes

- fix leaking internal reference to the record data  [#202](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/202) by [@ronag](@ronag)

### Enhancements

###### `listen(pattern, isSubscribed, response)`
add a third argument for the listen callback (`client.record.listen` and `client.event.listen`) which contains
an object which two functions (`accept` and `reject`). One of these functions needs to be called otherwise you
will get a deprecated message. [#203](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/203) [#212](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/212)

This enhancements fixes some issues like [#74](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/74) [#155](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/155) [#170](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/170)

###### provider flag and event
Records supports now a boolean flag (`record.hasProvider`) which indicates whether a listener has accepted providing data. You can also subscribe to event which is triggered when the flag changes:

```javascript
record.on('hasProviderChanged', hasProvider => {
  /* do something */
})
```

###### API checks are now in place that throw an error if you provide the incorrect argument amount or types [#207](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/pull/227) by [@ronag](@ronag)

### Misc

###### Gherkin tests are now used for E2E testing, allowing e2e tests to be run against any language rather than just node, and allows writing more scenarios much easier

## [1.0.2] - 2016-07-28

### Bug Fixes

- allow do create and discard the same record in a synchronous loop [#167](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/167)
- record snapshots are not waiting for `isReady` [#140](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/140)
- record subscriptions are not waiting for `isReady` in combination with `triggerNow` [#138](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/138)
- broken unsubscribe due to wrong internal argument delegation [#190](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/190)


### Enhancements

- provide a `MAX_RECONNECTION_ATTEMPTS_REACHED` event [#175](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/175)
- provide a `maxReconnectInterval` option [#176](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-client-js/issues/176)

###  Features

- Terminate unauthenticated connections after a timeout [#226](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/226)

## [1.0.1] - 2016-07-19

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where deleted record was not getting removed

## [1.0.0] - 2016-07-10

### Features

###### Merge Conflict Resolution #4
Users can now set a global and per record merge strategy. This allows the application to respond to `VERSION_EXISTS` and use a `REMOTE_WINS`, `LOCAL_WINS` or a custom merge strategy

Global:
```javascript
const client = deepstream( 'localhost:6020', {
    mergeStrategy: deepstream.MERGE_STRATEGIES.REMOTE_WINS
});
```

Local:
```javascript
const record = client.record.getRecord( 'user/1' )
record.setMergeStrategy( ( record, remoteValue, remoteVersion, callback ) => {
  callback( null, remoteValue )
} )
```


#### Enhancements

###### Connection Redirects
deepstream protocol now has a connection establishment handshake that allows the client to be redirected to another deepstream before requesting/publishing data

###### Record deletes #111
Users can now delete content within records by setting it to undefined

```javascript
record.set( path, undefined )
```

###### Reduced client size #75
Client size bundle has been reduced by not including mocks for the tcp connection

###### Discard/Delete only on ready #94
Record discards and deletes now get called after when ready, which makes the API cleaner

Before:
```javascript
record = client.record.getRecord( 'user1' )
record.set( 'name', 'bob' )
record.onReady( () => {
  record.discard()
})
```

Now:
```javascript
record = client.record.getRecord( 'user1' )
record
  .set( 'name', 'bob' )
  .discard()
```

###### Exposed Constants
You can now access constants on deepstream

```javascript
// on the constructor
const C = deepstream.CONSTANTS;
// and instance
const client = deepstream( 'localhost:6020' )
CONST C = client.CONSTANTS;
```

### Breaking Changes

###### Login callback

The login callback now only takes two arguments instead of three. This is to make it easier for the user to send their own custom data from an authentication hander or when using the http authentication handler

```javascript
client.login( {}, ( success, data ) => {
  if( success ) {
    // data is meta data associated with user session
    // or null
  } else {
    // data is error message or custom error object
    // with reason why or null
  }
} )
```

###### EngineIO Default Path
We now use `deepstream` instead of `engine.io` as the default engineio path

### Bug Fixes

- Login after logout doesn't overide auth parameters #88

- Deepstream not updating object properties #96 ( @drsirmrpresidentfathercharles )
